    "## What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where an internal node represents a feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. First, it learns to partition based on the attribute value. Then, it partitions the tree in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps you in decision-making. It's visualization like a flowchart diagram that easily mimics human-level thinking. That is why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.\n",
